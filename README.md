# MMFSTF

MMFSTF is a synomy of (Multi-Model Finite State Transducer Framework). It is a framework for building finite state transducers (FSTs) for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It is designed to be modular and extensible. 

It's built on top of RabbitMQ as a message broker and it's asynchronous by nature. It's designed to be used in a distributed environment, but can also be used in a single machine.
